One day of Raw Data used to take about 5 minutes to download. However, since a recent upgrade (somewhere around 15th May, 2021) it is no longer possible to retrieve raw trades older than 24 hours. This means that a start day must be fully specified (i.e. both date and time), and it must be less than 24 hours behind the current date/time. Keep this in mind when setting a start date. The reason for this is because they do not support fetching of OHCLV data - this data has to be compiled by fetching individual trades. The fetching of trades is limited to 100 trades per request, and the rate limit is 1 second. Furthermore, you will need to run data mining for at least 24 hours before being able to start running any trading.",
