This is important to free up hardware resources for other bots running on the same machine. However, there is some information Bots need to remember between each execution of the Main Loop, and between executions of the Task itself. That info is stored in a JSON / text file called the Status Report. The name Status was used since the information stored is often the status of the Bot's process. Here is an example of a simple Status Report file:",
