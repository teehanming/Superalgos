One of the many Big Questions we face in the community is how to run multiple instances of SA at the same time. This is totally achievable and indeed it's really easy but, please, read everything carefully because this is not exempted from downsides. So first of all let's see how to configure SA to achieve this feature and at the end of this How To you will find what aspects to consider.",

But note that changing the values in the Environment.js file could not be sufficient though. Superalgos saves these values not only as global variables but as straight values when you save a workspace, for example. You must then be sure to change these parameters in all your SA install. One way to achieve this quickly is to use a software like VSCode that let you do a search and replace in a whole directory.",
