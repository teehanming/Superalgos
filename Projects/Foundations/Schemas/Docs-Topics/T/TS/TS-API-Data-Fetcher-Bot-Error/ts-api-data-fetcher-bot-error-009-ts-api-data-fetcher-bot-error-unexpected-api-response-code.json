        "text": "The API response included a response / status code that was not expected by the API Map definitions. Each API Query Response node at the API Endpoint needs to have a config property called codeName with a value equals to the response code sent by the API server. For instance, 200 is the standard OK response, but the server might have another code or this call might have produced an unconventional response from the API server with a different response code that the API Map did not expect. To solve this issue, you need to add a new a new API Query Response node with a config property equal to the code received (you can see it in the details below) in order for the API Data Fetcher Bot to know what to do when this happens. You also need to define this node children.",
